## My process

I started by analyzing the design and setting up a simple HTML structure for the QR component. Then, I focused on styling with CSS using Flexbox to perfectly center the container and applying spacing, colors, and typography based on the design. After achieving a clean desktop layout, I added responsive tweaks with media queries to make sure it looked great on mobile too. Finally, I deployed the project on Vercel and polished the README for presentation.
